# NYUAD Orchestra Logo Demo

Last semester, I heard how the NYUAD Orchestra is looking for an interactive logo, and grabbing this opportunity, I thought I could create a potentially impactful class project. The idea was to create a Google Doodle-like logo that uses machine learning and computer vision to make the logo interact with the user. Since it is a logo for an orchestra I taught the best would be if I create a game where swinging with your hands as if you were conducting makes the logo move. 

## Getting started

Clone the project from Github, and install express in the project folder

```
npm install express
```

The run the server

```
node server.js
```

Navigate to localhost:8080, allow webcamera access, scroll to the bottom of the page. There you find the machine elarning dashboard for training and running. To run, click load (to load a previously trained model) then click run. You're good to go.

## Components 
node.js
ml.js
tone.js
p5.js
